# -Human-Resource-Employees-Distribution
"A data-driven HR analytics dashboard built using SQL and Power BI to visualize employee distribution, diversity, and departmental trends from 22,000+ records."
In this exciting project, Main objective was to unleash the power of feature engineering, data cleaning, and thorough data analysis using SQL.

I have used SQL queries to extract and visualize data in Power BI from a rich dataset comprising over 22000 records spanning from 2000 to 2020, sourced from Github.

Throughout the project, I have delved into creating a database, fine-tuning tables and columns, refining data types, and formatting date and age columns to ensure the most compelling insights.

Additionally, I have applied filtering techniques, implemented case statements, and utilized subqueries to drive comprehensive analysis and uncover valuable patterns within the data.
